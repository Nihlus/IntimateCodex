What is it?
———————————————————

Intimate Codex is a text explorer that lets you explore static text form a more first person perspective. Books or poems or whatever you feed into it are broken up into lines that you can bounce between by typing in text-adventure style commands (the overall experience was inspired by Her Story).

Instead of full commands, though, you type in a single word and are brought to a new passage that shares that word.

By providing connections between different passages (and even entirely different works) based on keywords and randomness new narratives and means appear that can be vastly different from the original, linear stories.

Me, Andy Wallace! You can check out my website at andymakesgames.com or follow me on twitter @andy_makes!

———————————————————
It it a game?
———————————————————

Maybe! There are no goals and no way to win or loose, but the experience is definitely playful.

———————————————————
Is it poetry?
———————————————————

Probably!

———————————————————
Can I change What text files that it draws from?
———————————————————

Absolutely! There are several fantastic public domain novels that come preloaded with Intimate Codex, but you are encouraged to swap them out for your own!

All of the text is loaded from data/text folder. The data folder must be in the same place as the app for it to work so please don’t move it.

All text files in the data/text folder will be loaded when the application starts, creating a ix-and-match tapestry of passages. You are free to add your own files and remove the ones in there by default, but all files must use the extension “.txt”

Play around with other bodies of text and see what feels fun or manful to you.

You can even put this read in there, although I don’t really recommend it.

———————————————————
What if I only want to use one passage instead of having it draw from all of them?
———————————————————

While the app is running, you can load a single text file from that folder by writing
“load[name of text file without txt extension]”

For example, to load macbeth.txt, you would type “loadmacbeth” in the app.
You will hear a ding if it found a file to load.

You can type “loadall” to load everything in the text folder. This is what the app does by default when it first launches.

———————————————————
Can I write my own text to explore?
———————————————————

I hope you do! Larger bodies of text always work better (think 1000 lines versus 100), but even smaller bits of text can be mixed in with the other text files being loaded. All you need to do is make sure that what you write is stored in a .txt file and that you use line breaks to split up lines (basically, just hit the enter key).

———————————————————
What if I don’t want it to be full screen?
———————————————————

You can toggle full screen by clicking the top left corner of the app.

This started as a small text experiment I made for a friend’s party in October of 2015. It was created using openFrameworks.
