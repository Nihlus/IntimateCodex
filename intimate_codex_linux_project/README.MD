# Template Project to run OpenFrameworks in CLion on Linux 64

based on a similar project for [OSX](https://github.com/judepereira/44a)

## HOWTO
Import this as an existing project in CLion, and don't choose the option to re-create the CMakeLists.txt.
Open CMakeLists.txt, and on line 6, update the path to your oF root path

## Compatibility
This has been tested with oF 0.9.0, Linux Mint 17 and CLion 1.2.4
